# MemeMe

## Overview

MemeMe is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user can share it with friends. MemeMe also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table or a grid.

## What did I learn

* Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
* Build tables with datasources and delegates
* Create custom table view cells
* Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views

## Why is this project meaningful
* Becoming comfortable using all of the key components of UIKit is an essential step in becoming an iOS developer.
* Understanding UIKit allows a developer to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that they use.
* Mastering UKit fundamentals frees a developer up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.
